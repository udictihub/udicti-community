A semester has approximately 15-16 weeks. Leaving 2 weeks for University Exams we will have 13-14 weeks sharp. 

### We will have two programs.
- Upskilling Talent Program
- Startup program

# STARTUP PROGRAM
Our target for the next year is to raise six(6)-ten(10) strong startups.

## How do we make it?

They will be introduced to the hub for the first year during orientation week, which doesn’t account for the 15 weeks of a regular calendar.

During the orientation, the students will have to apply to get a chance to be in Udicti Community. Why will they apply, it's because we want to filter the best, most determined, and disciplined members. 

This application will be open to all students, as we discussed earlier it’s wise to move with the second year and above because they are already familiar with University life and will have a high chance of already figuring out what they want to do.

Despite this, this will not hinder serious first-year students from getting into the program.

When we officially Open We will drill the plan as follows:

This program we have partenered with **StartHubAfrica** in training students on tech-preneurship.

| Duration(When ?)   | Activity   |  Explanation  | Deliverables     |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase A  (week 1 - 4)      | Basics on building an Innovative Business                                 | Here they will learn: Design Thinking Problem Identification and Defining Lean Startup Business Model Team Building Management(Belbin Model)  | Registration database Understanding of business creation process Teams formed     |
| Phase B (week 5 - 8)                   | This phase is divided into two mini-phases (Startup & Capacity Building ) | Here there will be: Issuing an application form to choose btn startup / capacity building After 2 weeks  results will come out Startup will proceed with: Problem research and definition Then HCD Then Business Model Then Pitch Deck and pitching skills training On the part of capacity building we shall  Training sessions Project Assignments Assignment of Mentorship | Application form Results Problem Definition Business Models  Pitch Decks Pitching |
| Phase C (week 9-13)                    | Initial Protoyping Phase                                                  | startups Will build prototypes and present their prototypes and pitch decks. Capacity building -  will build their project prototypes and have initial documentation of the projects, they will present and receive feedback | Prototypes Documentations 2nd pitch decks |
|  Week 14  (rest and preparing with UE) |    |  |                                                                                   |
| Week 15 and 16 (UE)      |     |   |                                                                                   |
| Holiday  | Market Testing and receiving feedback  | They will get an official letter to allow them to do public research and be educated on how to comply with legal term  use of the obtained data. | Research letter Short training in data privacy  |

Now semester one is over.

But apart from that they will be other hub activities
Also , in the startup section we shall only take 12 teams, others will fall into capacity building

We plan to have corporate sessions after every 2 weeks where we will invite someone from the corporate world to share his / her experience and skills in the ICT and Innovation Ecosystem in different fields. 


This will be on Saturdays. (snacks , drinks , projector )

This aims at building networks , creating mentors and increasing exposure and integrating the University Hub with other stakeholders of the ecosystem.

And in a semester there will be 3 hackathons(Hackathons are short technological competitions that aim at capacity building and test the ability of individuals to solve problems efficiently in a short period of time)
            (projector, snacks , drinks and prize money)

# SEMESTER TWO


| duration  | Activity   | Explanation   | Deliverables  |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase D  (week 1 -4)   | Product Refining          | Here there will be: Research finding presentation and receive feedback Building a Minimum Viable Product (progress check after every 2 weeks) | Research findings Minimum Viable Products 1.0     |
| Phase C (week 5 and 6) | Market Ready?   | The startups will pitch and show their MVPs and market readiness strategies  | Market Readiness Strategy MVP build version 1.1   |

| Phase E(week 13 )      | Investment and Graduation | Pitch to investors   | Initial seed funding  |

Other Activities

**There will be other programs that will be happening in the Innovation and Startup ecosystem.**

- Coict Research and Innovation Week
- Innovation Week Dar Edition
- Innovation Week Dodoma Edition x Makisatu
- Stakeholders conferences, networking sessions, hackathons and incubation programs
(All these activities require active participation and some require funds to facilitate active participation )
- My suggestion is to set aside funds for students to participate in these innovation programs from the ecosystem.
Other Activities

- To have an  ICT Career and Startup Fair
(This fair will be in week 13 )
- Briefly the fair will aim at linking together the corporate world , other stakeholders of the innovation ecosystem to showcase products , talents , skills and network.

SEMESTER TWO

In semester two, we will focus on building projects to build each student's portfolio. The projects will be focused on real-life challenges and designing a good tech solution, also intensive analysis of the existing solutions and how to make them better. 

It's a good time to introduce the student to the existing market and the rates which it operates with. Help students craft their software development CVs and Portfolios.

The aim is to create problem solvers, who are user-centric and build the best products and keep iterating to suit the user needs and the changing environments.
